Purpose: The lm() function fits a linear regression model where:
y is the dependent variable.
x is the independent variable.
This creates a model object (relationship_model) that stores information about the linear relationship, such as coefficients, residuals, and fitted values.

Purpose: The summary() function provides detailed statistical information:
Coefficients:
Estimate for intercept and slope.
Standard errors, t-values, and p-values for testing their significance.
Residuals: Differences between observed and predicted values.
Model Fit:
R-squared: How much of the variation in y is explained by x.
F-statistic: Overall significance of the regression.
