explanation

Loading and Inspecting Data:

input <- warpbreaks: Loads the warpbreaks dataset into the variable input.
print(head(input)): Prints the first few rows of the dataset so you can understand its structure.
Creating the GLM:

output <- glm(formula = breaks ~ wool + tension, data = warpbreaks, family = poisson): This line fits a Generalized Linear Model (GLM) to the data using the Poisson distribution. It models the number of breaks as a function of the categorical predictors wool and tension.
Displaying the Model Summary:

print(summary(output)): This prints a detailed summary of the fitted model, including coefficients, standard errors, z-values, p-values, and more, which helps you understand the relationships between the predictors and the outcome.
Optional - Diagnostic Plot:

plot(output): This generates a diagnostic plot to assess the residuals and check for issues like non-linearity, heteroscedasticity, or outliers in the model.
